# Scam Detection with Naïve Bayes and Active Learning

This project applies a multinomial Naïve Bayes model to detect scam messages, and explores the use of active learning to improve model performance. A supervised baseline model is compared against a semi-supervised model trained using selected informative instances. The analysis focuses on model representation, feature importance, and classification confidence.
